**Introduction to Git & GitHub**
-----------------------------

**Definitions**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Git* - tool for version control.

*GitHub* - hosted server that is also interactive.

*repo* - short for repository; GitHub lets you create a remote repository online.

*local* - on your personal computer.

*clone* - copy of a repository that lives locally on your computer. Pushing changes will affect the repository online.

*fetch* - getting latest changes to the repository on your local computer.

*branch* - parallel to the master branch; allows you to make changes without affecting the master branch. Changes made on a 
branch can be merged back to the master.

*fork* - copy of someone else's repository stored locally on your account. From forks, you can make pull requests to the master branch.

*upstream* - primary or master branch of original repository.

*downstream* - branch or fork of repository.

*commit* - finalize a change.

*push* - add changes back to the remote repository.

*merge* - takes changes from a branch or fork and applies them to the master.

*pull request* - proposed changes to/within a repository.

*issue* - suggestions or tasks needed for the repository. Allows you to track decisions, bugs with the repository, etc.

**Introduction**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will learn how to:

- create a repository
	- best practices
	- create an issue
	- push/pull files
	- commit to GitHub
	
- interact with the GitHub environment
	- using the web interface
	- using GitHub Desktop

- advanced GitHub
	- branching
	- forking
	- merging
	- versioning

GitHub makes it easy to keep track of changes and has a built in version control.

**Background**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GitHub Uses
===========

- Version control
- Collaborative projects
- Creating websites
- Teaching tools
- Software development
- Code development

..
.. note:: Git is not really for storing or manipulating data, especially large files. But the `CyVerse Discovery Environment <https://de.cyverse.org/de/>`_ is a great place to serve, store, and share data.
